# YouTube-API
Welcome to the DRI Digital Democracy Github repository! Here you will find documentation for working with the YouTube API as well as lessons learned and cleaned code from previous DD projects.

# Best Practice
I would ask that after completing any project involving working with YouTube's API, please upload your own lessons learned and cleaned code to this respository.

Thanks!
